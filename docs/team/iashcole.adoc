== PROJECT: Book Inventory

---

== Overview

BookInventory is a desktop application used for small to medium book owners. It can be used to track activities such as revenue and stock of the books. The user mainly interacts with the application using Command Line Interface (CLI), and it also has a built-in GUI created with JavaFX. The main code is written in Java and contains approximately 10,000 Lines of Code (LoC).

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added a password field for security
** What it does: allow users to key in a password before using the application. This is to prevent unauthorized users from using the application.
** Justification: This is to prevent unauthorized users from using the application because they might temper with the data.
** Highlights: The code is written before the application starts, this is to prevent any unnecessary load-up from the application, freeing space and data for the user. The implementation was challenging at first as you require a basic knowledge of JavaFX.

* *Minor enhancement*: change regular expressions (regex) in the code

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com[Functional code]] [https://github.com[Test code]]

=== Key-in password

****
* A password will be required by the application to use it.
* If you do not know the password, please contact us using github directly.
* For the sake of this early development of the program, the password for the admin: "owner"; student: "password"; accountant: "accountant".
* Different roles have different sets of permission ie commands.
